            This school was founded by a very special Teacher. Grandmaster Seok
            Joo &ldquo;Tiger&ldquo; Cheong was born in Korea and raised in the finest
            institutions to learn the Martial Art of Taekwondo, widely regarded
            as Korea&quot;s gift to the world. Grandmaster Tiger came to the states
            back in the late 80&quot;s to start a school to allow anyone and everyone
            to come in and better themselves. He had discovered his talent for
            teaching after offering instruction in self defense to his workers
            when he was a construction foreman in Kuwait back in the 70&quot;s. Some
            Taekwondo historians argue that Grandmaster Tiger is the one
            responsible for bringing Taekwondo to the Middle East! What started
            as a way to protect the people in his charge would later reveal
            itself to be his place in this world. In 1990, this school&quot;s doors
            opened for the first time and have remained open to everyone ever
            since.

            We are dedicated to keeping the ideals of Grandmaster Tiger ever
            present in our class. Grandmaster Tiger was a gentleman and a gentle
            man; our teaching style will always embody this. No matter what
            skill level our students may possess, we are here to believe in
            every one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you are learning from us, we do our utmost to make sure you
            are a gentle warrior in a beautiful garden of all your friends and
            classmates; challenging yourself to grow and encouraging everyone
            else to do the same. You will be shown incredible abilities which
            will be used to protect yourself and everyone close to you. You will
            look this power in the eye and bring it all under your control. You
            will be shown all the nuances of your power so you may keep fear
            from reaching those you care about.
          </p>
          <p>But knowing all of this is only half the battle.</p>
          <p>
            As disciples of Grandmaster Tiger, we will be here to guide every
            one of our students to see the big picture; to help them see what is
            good for them and everyone around them in the present moment and for
            what is to come. Helping find one&quot;s place in the world is crucial at
            any age. For youngsters, this helps to get them ready to seek out
            who they are and what they want to be, giving them a jump-start on
            their adult life; whenever maturity may reach them, they will be
            ready. For those taking class with us later in their lives, we offer
            a way to extend your well-being as far as we can take it, and even
            offer a path to enlightenment should you come here seeking something
            more for yourself.

            At first it may seem that Martial Arts has no definitive function or
            form, and this is what gives it so much meaning! Martial Arts can be
            ANYTHING, so come on over and make it into whatever you want it to
            be! Find your place here, and continue the story that Grandmaster
